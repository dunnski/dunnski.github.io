The main reason for this is so your AV doesn’t accidentally delete and/or block a sample when you are trying to work on them. In this short post we will go through some steps to disable Windows Defender on our analysis VM.

We successfully stood up two VMs; a Windows(FLARE) machine and a Linux(REMnux) machine. Put them on their own isolated virtual network without access to the internet. Lastly, we configured FLARE to use REMnux as its Gateway and DNS so that we could monitor its network communicati... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Malware Analysis Series - Part 1, Setting Up a Basic Malware Analysis Virtual Lab</title><link href="https://dunnski.github.io/posts/how_to_set_up_homelab_blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Malware Analysis Series - Part 1, Setting Up a Basic Malware Analysis Virtual Lab" /><published>2021-08-01T08:00:00-04:00</published> <updated>2022-06-02T10:18:25-04:00</updated> <id>https://dunnski.github.io/posts/how_to_set_up_homelab_blog/</id> <content src="https://dunnski.github.io/posts/how_to_set_up_homelab_blog/" /> <author> <name>Joshua</name> </author> <category term="Malware Analysis Series" /> <category term="How to" /> <summary> Introduction: Since joining the Cyber Security and Intelligence community in 2016, I’ve always had a strong interest in malware analysis. The process of breaking something down, looking at its individual parts, testing hypotheses as to what its capabilities are. This is something that has always drawn me to the field. Its also a field that is extremely new to me. I’ve only just started to l... </summary> </entry> </feed>
